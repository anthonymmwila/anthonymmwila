# Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony.
I am an aspiring Software Engineer-cum-UI/UX 
Developer. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's
degree of Science In Computing, (BscCOM) at Cavendish University Zambia.
Along with supposed expertise in Full-stack 
development, I possess an unwavering and fierce 
passion for UI/UX design and development. Being
able to provide users with that exquisite feel
and experience is what excites me the most.
Throughout the course of my academic journey so
far, I have gained reasonable experience in various 
fields of the industry, including System Analysis & 
Design, Computer Hardware & Maintenance, Computer 
Ethics & Professionalism... and many more. I have
also worked in teams, both in and outside the Computer 
Science scope and this has added to my experience and
skill in Communication and Collaboration.
